## How to import a case template in TheHive

You must be logged with a user that has the `manageCaseTemplate` permission. 

Go into `Organization`(1) page and open the `Case templates`(2) tab. Click on `Import Case Template`(3) then provide the JSON file that contains the case template.

## How to share your case template 

> :warning: **Please consider the following points before sharing a case template**: 
> 
> - Don't include customFields in your case template. Currently TheHive will NOT import the case templates that include customFields not created BEFORE importing case template.
> - Ensure there are no sensitive information in the case template you will share.

Once your case template is ready to be shared, you need to export it as a JSON file.

In TheHive, go into the `Case templates` tab in `Organization`, and open the action menu of the case template. Use the `Export case template` action to download the template as a JSON file. 

Finally, open an issue on this repository with the JSON file attached. Once reviewed and validated by StrangeBee crew, your case template will be published. Thanks for your contribution !
