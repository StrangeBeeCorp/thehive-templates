This will help analyzing the situation and prevent you from starting a takedown procedure on a “forgotten” legitimate website.\n▪ Prepare one web page hosted on your infrastructure, ready to be published anytime, to warn your customers about a large ongoing fraudulent scam attack. Prepare and test a clear deployment procedure as well.\n▪ Prepare takedown e-mail forms. You will use them for every fraudulent scam case, if possible, in several languages. This will speed up things when trying to reach Internet operating companies during the takedown process.\n▪ Have several ways to be reached in a timely manner (24/7 if possible):\n  o E-Mail address, easy to remember for everyone (ex: security@yourcompany)\n  o Web forms on your company’s website (location of the form is important, no more than 2 clicks away from the main page)\n  o Visible Twitter account\n▪ Deploy DKIM, DMARC and SPF to all mail chain.\n\n**Contacts**\n▪ Maintain a list of all people accredited to take decisions on cybercrime and eventual actions regarding the topic. If possible, establish a contract with clear processes.\n▪ Establish and maintain a list of takedown contacts in:\n  o Hosting companies\n  o Registrars\n  o Registry companies\n  o E-Mail providers\n▪ Establish and maintain contacts in CERTs worldwide, they will probably always be able to help if involved.\n\n> **Raise customer awareness**\n> Don’t wait for scam incidents to communicate with your customers.
