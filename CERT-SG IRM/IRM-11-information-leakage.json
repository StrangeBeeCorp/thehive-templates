Based on your legal team advisory, a written permission from the concerned user might also be handy.**\n\n- E-Mail:\nThe disclosure source could have sent data using his corporate e-mail address.\n\nOn the messaging system, look for e-mails sent to or received from a suspect account or with a special subject.\nOn the e-mail client on the desktop of the suspect (if available), use a tool which allows you to search by filtering out the\n“PRIVATE” flagged e-mails. If you really need to do so, ask the user for a written agreement or ask him to be with you.\nWhen applicable, look through related log files.\n\nUse forensic tools to check for deleted browsing history. Also check all the offline content left from all browsing.\n\n- Browsing:\nData might have been sent on webmail/forums/dedicated websites. On the proxy server, check the logs relating to the suspect account connections on the suspected URL used to disclose data. \nOn the desktop (if available), check the history of the installed browsers. Remember some people might have different\nbrowsers on the same desktop computer; be sure to check every browser history. If the moment of the data leak can be\ntime-stamped, some log files can provide useful information.\n\n- External storage devices:\nA various number of devices can be used to store data: USB keys, CD-ROM, DVD, external hard disks, smartphones,\nmemory cards…\nLittle information will be found concerning data transfer using these devices. The USB key used to transfer data can be\nreferenced by the operating system. A forensic analysis can confirm the use of hardware but not the data transmitted.\n\n- Local files:\nIf nothing has been found yet, there are still chances to find traces in the local file system of the suspect. Just like for e-mail researches, use a parsing tool which forbids any access to the PRIVATE zone of the user. If you really need to do so, act accordingly to local employment law.\n\n- Network transfer:\nMultiple ways might be used to transfer data out of the company: FTP, instant messenger, etc. Try to dig into log files\nshowing such activity. Data might also have been sent using a VPN tunnel or on an SSH server. In this case, one can prove the connection by watching log files but can’t see the content transmitted.\n\n- Printer:\nData can be sent to printers connected to the network. In this case, check for traces on the spooler or directly on the printer, since some constructors directly store printed documents on a local hard drive.\n\n- Malware:\nIf nothing has been found, think of a possible malware compromission and act accordingly with the “Malware\nDetection” IRM.\n\nNote: Even when enough evidence has been found, always look for more. It is not because you proved that data got fraudulently from A to B with one method that it wasn’t also sent to C with another method. Also don’t forget that someone else could have accessed the computer. Was the suspected employee actually in front of his computer when the leak occured?","status":"Waiting","flag":false,"order":3,"extraData":{}},{"_id":"~2376913136","_type":"Task","_createdBy":"florian@strangebee.com","_createdAt":1651852784838,"title":"Mitigation","group":"Containment","description":"**Objective: Mitigate the attack’s effects on the targeted environment.**\n\nNotify the management, legal and PR team to make sure they are prepared to deal with a massive or targeted disclosure.\n\nDepending on the leakage vector, block the access to the disclosure URI, the disclosure server, the disclosure source or the disclosure recipients.
