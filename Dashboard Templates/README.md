## How to share your Dashboards

> :warning: **Please consider the following points before sharing a case template**: 
> 
> Be careful not to share sensitive information such as internal tags, customfields or any other information that may be included, such as titles or filters in the dashboards
> 

Once your dashboard is ready to be shared, you need to export it as a JSON file.

In TheHive, go into the `Dashboard` menu, and open the action menu of the dashboard you want to share. Use the `Export` action to download the dashboard as a JSON file. 

Finally, open a pull request containing your dashboard as JSON file. Once reviewed and validated by StrangeBee crew, your dashboard will be published. Thanks for your contribution !
