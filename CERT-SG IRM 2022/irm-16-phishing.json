Check there is no suspicious referrer bringing people to your website. This is often the case when the phishing websites brings the user to the legitimate website after he’s been cheated.\n\n**Phishing attack scoping**\n▪ Determine the number of targeted users.\n▪ Search for exploited compromised accounts and identify related malicious activities.\n\n**Analyze the phishing**\nRemember to follow established analysis procedures\n▪ Determine:\n  o If it is a credential harvesting campaign or a malware spreading campaign\n  o If it is a targeted campaign or not\n▪ Inspect message subject and body.\n▪ Use sandbox environment to analyse malicious attachments and extract IOCs.\n▪ Analyse links, domain and hostnames with threat intelligence services.\n▪ Check the source-code of the phishing website.\n▪ Investigate email headers for interesting artifacts: originated server and sender information for example.\n\n**Collect evidence**\nMake a time-stamped copy of the phishing web pages.
