By keeping them on different places, it reduces risk of a single event destroying multiple copies.\n• In **two different formats**: this means that you must use at least two different methods to store your data. For example, DVD, Hard drive, Cloud services are different formats. But if you store two copies into two hard drive, here you will just use one format.\n• With **one of those copies offsite**: Keeping one copy off-site ensures that even whatever happen where your data is (fire, break-in, natural disaster...) at least one copy is safe somewhere else. In this rule, cloud services make sense.\n\nTry to use one backup format stored out of your network: even lateral movement happens from the threat that harm your network with encryption one copy will be out of reach.","status":"Waiting","flag":false,"order":0,"extraData":{}},{"_id":"~3809447960","_type":"Task","_createdBy":"florian@strangebee.com","_createdAt":1670519504759,"title":"Identification","group":"default","description":"## OBJECTIVE: DETECT THE INCIDENT, DETERMINE ITS SCOPE, AND INVOLVE THE APPROPRIATE PARTIES.\n\n\n### GENERAL SIGNS OF RANSOMWARE PRESENCE\n\n**Several leads might hint that the system could be compromised by ransomware:**\n▪ Monitoring of ransomware IOCs by a SOC.\n▪ Supervision of EDR alerts.\n▪ Odd professional emails (often masquerading as invoices) containing attachments are being received.\n▪ A ransom message explaining that the documents have been encrypted and asking for money is displayed on user’s desktop.\n▪ People are complaining about their files not being available or corrupted on their computers or their network shares with unusual extensions (.abc, .xyz, .aaa, etc.).\n▪ Numerous files are being modified in a very short period of time on the network shares.\n▪ Publication of information on the ransomware operator websites or forums.\n▪ Lateral movement is usually done, check all connection to the AD and ShareFile server with privileged accounts at abnormal day time.\n▪ Look for unusual network or web browsing activities; especially connections to Tor I2P IP, Tor gateways (tor2web, etc.) or Bitcoin payment websites.\n▪ Look for rare connections.\n\n---\n**Scoping of the incident:**\n▪ EDR or large-scale hunting tools like YARA or DFIR-ORC allows to make the scoping of the ransomware infected machines.\n▪ The identification of the initial access and the pivot used by the attackers is the priority, as in Large scale malware compromise.
