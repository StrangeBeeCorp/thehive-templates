Remember that the cause of the leakage can be an individual employee willingly or unwillingly bypassing security issues, or a compromised computer(i.e., large scale/ransomware).\n---\n1 - Detect the issue\n**Incident notification process:**\n▪ Internal information can be a good source of detection: employee confidence, security team identifying a problem, etc. \n**Public monitoring tool:**\n▪ A watch on Internet search engines and public database can be very valuable to detect information leakage.\n▪ Monitor ransomware shaming list websites to detect potential data leakage including third-parties. \n**DLP (Data Loss Prevention) tool:**\n▪ If there is a DLP tool in the company, it can provide valuable information to incident handlers working on information leakage.\n---\n2 - Confirm the issue\n> Don’t do anything, without a written request from the concerned CISO/person in charge. Based on your legal team advisory, a written permission from the concerned user might also be handy.\n\n**E-Mail:**\n▪ The disclosure source could have sent data using his corporate e-mail address.\n▪ On the messaging system, look for e-mails sent to or received from a suspect account or with a special subject.\n▪ On the e-mail client on the desktop of the suspect (if available), use a tool which allows you to search by filtering out the “PRIVATE” flagged e-mails. If you really need to do so, ask the user for a written agreement, or ask him to be with you.\n▪ When applicable, look through related log files.\n\n**Browsing:**\n▪ Data might have been sent on webmail/forums/dedicated websites.\n▪ On the proxy server or SIEM, check the logs relating to the suspect account connections on the suspected URL used to disclose data.\n▪ On the desktop (if available), check the history of the installed browsers. Remember some people might have different browsers on the same desktop computer; be sure to check every browser history. If the moment of the data leak can be time-stamped, some log files can provide useful information.\n\n**External storage devices:**\n▪ A various number of devices can be used to store data: USB keys, CD-ROM, DVD, external hard disks, smartphones, memory cards…\n▪ Little information will be found concerning data transfer using these devices. The USB key used to transfer data can be referenced by the operating system. A forensic analysis can confirm the use of hardware but not the data transmitted.\n\n**Local files:**\n▪ If nothing has been found yet, there are still chances to find traces in the local file system of the suspect. Just like for e-mail researches, use a parsing tool which forbids any access to the PRIVATE zone of the user. If you really need to do so, act accordingly to local employment law.\n\n**Network transfer:**\n▪ Multiple ways might be used to transfer data out of the company: FTP, instant messenger, etc. Try to dig into log files showing such activity.\n▪ Data might also have been sent using a VPN tunnel or on an SSH server. In this case, one can prove the connection by watching log files but can’t see the content transmitted.\n\n**Printer:**\n▪ Data can be sent to printers connected to the network. In this case, check for traces on the spooler or directly on the printer, since some constructors directly store printed documents on a local hard\ndrive.\n\n**Malware/Ransomware:**\nA malware/ransomware compromise can be at the source of an information leakage and must be treated accordingly with the “Malware Detection” IRM 7 or “Ransomware” IRM 17.\n\n> At the end of this phase, you may consider involving law enforcement services and regulators if required. Even when enough evidence has been found, always look for more. It is not because you proved that data got fraudulently from A to B with one method that it wasn’t also sent to C with another method. Also don’t forget that someone else could have accessed the computer. Was the suspected employee actually in front of his computer when the leak occurred?\n\n---\n3 - Analyze concerned data if available\n▪ Sometime, leaked data can be downloaded and analyzed by security team. Ransomware shaming list website often publish leaked information.\n▪ Using data analysis tools like Aleph can help legal teams to decide what actions need to be taken.\n\n> At the end of this phase, you may consider involving law enforcement services and regulators if required.","status":"Waiting","flag":false,"order":1,"extraData":{}},{"_id":"~3031076904","_type":"Task","_createdBy":"florian@strangebee.com","_createdAt":1670343725897,"title":"Remediation","group":"default","description":"## OBJECTIVE: TAKE ACTIONS TO REMOVE THE THREAT AND AVOID FUTURE INCIDENTS.\n\n▪ If data has been sent to public servers, ask the owner (or webmaster) to remove the disclosed data.
