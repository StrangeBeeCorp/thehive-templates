Make sure that you have the possibility to use an out-of-band communication channel (e.g.: phone).\n▪ Make sure your ISP and DDoS mitigation service have a 24/7 phone support.\n\n---\n**Inventory**\n▪ Create a whitelist of the IP addresses and protocols you must allow if prioritizing traffic during an attack. Don’t forget to include your critical customers, key partners, etc.\n▪ Document your IT infrastructure details, including business owners, IP addresses and circuit IDs, routing settings (AS, etc); prepare a network topology diagram and an asset inventory. Network infrastructure\n▪ Design a good network infrastructure without Single Point of Failure or bottleneck.\n▪ Deploy a Web Application Firewall to protect against application-layer DDoS.\n▪ Distribute your DNS servers and other critical services (SMTP, etc) through different AS.\n▪ Harden the configuration of network, OS, and application components that may be targeted by DDoS.\n▪ Baseline your current infrastructure’s performance, so you can identify the attack faster and more accurately.\n▪ If your business is Internet dependent, consider purchasing specialized DDoS mitigation products or services.\n▪ Confirm DNS time-to-live (TTL) settings for the systems that might be attacked. Lower the TTLs, if necessary, to facilitate DNS redirection if the original IP addresses get attacked. 600 is a good TTL value.\n▪ Depending of the criticality of your services, consider setting-up a backup that you can switch on in case of issue.\n\n---\n**Internal contacts**\n▪ Establish contacts for your IDS, firewall, systems, and network teams.\n▪ Collaborate with the business lines to understand business implications (e.g., money loss) of likely DDoS attack scenarios.\n▪ Involve your BCP/DR planning team on DDoS incidents.","status":"Waiting","flag":false,"order":0,"extraData":{}},{"_id":"~3076415632","_type":"Task","_createdBy":"florian@strangebee.com","_createdAt":1670261920970,"title":"Identification","group":"default","description":"## OBJECTIVE: DETECT THE INCIDENT, DETERMINE ITS SCOPE, AND INVOLVE THE APPROPRIATE PARTIES.\n\n\n**Communication**\n▪ Prepare an internal and an external communication template about DDoS incidents.\n▪ Identify channel where this communication will be posted.\n▪ The “preparation” phase is to be considered as the most important element of a successful DDoS incident response.\n\n---\n**Analyze the attack**\n▪ Keep in mind the DDoS attack could be a smokescreen hiding a more sophisticated and targeted attack.\n▪ Check your anti-DDoS service analysis and your scrubbing centre reports:\n  o Understand the logical flow of the DDoS attack and identify the infrastructure components affected by it.\n  o Understand if you are the target of the attack or a collateral victim.\n▪ Review the load and log files of servers, routers, firewalls, applications, and other affected infrastructure.\n▪ Identify what aspects of the DDoS traffic differentiate it from benign traffic:\n  o Source IP addresses, AS, etc\n  o Destination ports\n  o URLs\n  o Protocols flags\n\nNetwork analysis tools can be used to review the traffic:\n**➔Tcpdump, Tshark, Snort, Netflow, Ntop, MRTG, Cacti, Nagios**\n\nIf possible, create a NIDS signature to focus to differentiate between benign and malicious traffic.\n\n---\n**Involve internal and external actors**\n▪ Contact your internal teams to learn about their visibility into the attack.\n▪ Contact your ISP to ask for help.
